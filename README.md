# On the bias - sewing blog

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toratapp/teidsvag-portfolio/main/images/onthebias-home-web.jpg)

Noroff school assignment, Front-end development. The assignment was to design and build a website with blog posts and an about- and contact page.


## Description
On the bias is a sewing blog with posts about the author's projects and learning material that help you get better at sewing. In this assignment I learned how to make a carousel that shows a few posts at a time and lets the viewer click to see more rows of posts. I made the blog posts on a headless WordPress site and added them to my website with the Wordpress REST API. On the contact page, the form has JavaScript validation.


## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Wordpress REST API


## Installing and running
Clone the repo, open in Visual Studio Code and run with Live Server. You can also deploy with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Acknowledgments
- For the Carousel I picked up some tips from these videos on YouTube: [Karl Hadwen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gor5BvT2z88) and [Noroff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As2EuVlsQ9E)
- I learned more about animation here: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations)
- To help me figure out how to make image modals I looked at these pages: [Kevin Powell](https://codepen.io/kevinpowell/pen/KKyOYvM), [Stack overflow 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3369593/how-to-detect-escape-key-press-with-pure-js-or-jquery) and [Stack overflow 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37926298/javascript-modal-close-image-by-clicking-anywhere-outside-the-image)
- I had some difficulty figuring out how to show the date on the blog post correctly, this helped me: [Codegrepper]()

I read a lot of helpful learning material on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) about forms, Flexbox and CSS Grids.

All icons I have used are from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
